Rouge Score & Bleu Score for Summary Comparison:

Both Rouge and Bleu are popular metrics used to evaluate and compare the quality of summaries. 
They do this by measuring how similar the generated summary is to a reference summary, typically written by a human.

Rouge:

Focuses on n-gram overlap. This means it counts how many sequences of consecutive words (n-grams) appear in both the generated and reference summaries.
Available in various versions like ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bigrams), and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence).

Strengths: Simple to understand, interpretable, widely used.

Weaknesses: Ignores semantic equivalence and information gain. Might favor summaries that simply copy phrases from the reference text.
Bleu:

Similar to Rouge, but also penalizes summaries that are too short compared to the reference.
Focuses on n-gram precision, meaning it rewards summaries that contain relevant n-grams from the reference text.

Strengths: Encourages informative summaries, penalizes overly concise ones.

Weaknesses: Similar to Rouge, can be sensitive to word order and may not capture semantic similarity.
Using these scores for comparison:

Compare individual scores (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, Bleu) to understand how well the summary captures different aspects of the reference text (word overlap, information, length).
Use combined scores or their averages to get an overall sense of similarity.
Remember, higher scores generally indicate better summaries, but interpret them with caution. Consider factors like fluency, coherence, and information loss that these scores might not capture.


For Reference: 
Rouge:

ROUGE-1: Scores above 0.7 are generally considered good, while below 0.5 might indicate significant differences.
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L: Scores above 0.5 are usually good, while below 0.3 might suggest major gaps in information or word overlap.

Bleu:
Scores above 0.8 are generally excellent, while below 0.4 might indicate significant information loss or lack of relevant content.
